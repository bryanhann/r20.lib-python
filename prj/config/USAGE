DESCRIPTION
     Run [cmd ...] in a virtual environment


OPTIONS:
     -h         Display this help page
     -c         Clear the cache first

INTERNALS:
     When called ./with will 

     1) install a virtual environment
     2) activate that virtual environment
     3) reconfigure the PYTHONPATH environment varable
     4) set the environment variable RXX to the containing folder
     5) copy a script 'rxx' to ~/.local/bin
     6) execute the cmd with it's arguments
     7) exit

     Configuration is determined in ./config/activate

     The rxx script is used as a front end to ./bin and works
     by simply calling '$RXX/bin/$*'. This is one reason why 
     the RXX environment variable is set.
